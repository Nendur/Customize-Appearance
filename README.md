# Customize Appearance

### A modding project for Crusader Kings II

Customize Appearance allows more character customization through the selection of outfits and hairstyles. It adds a targetted decision in the right-click menu to all characters to open the customization menu.
The changes to game scripts include additional clean-up and bugfixing.

Customizable properties:
list
-Clothing.
-Headgear.
-French headgear accessories.
-Hairstyle.
-Beardstyle.
-Scars.
-Eye patches.
-Masks.
-Deactivate society clothing.
-Hide African totem masks.

Compatibility:

This has likely incompatibilities with mods that change the portrait properties (in interface\portrait_properties) or the society portraits (in interface\portraits). I will not be making any other versions, but will give open permission for adaptions.

Not ironman compatible.

Not compatible with Better Looking Garbs, use the built-in version instead.
